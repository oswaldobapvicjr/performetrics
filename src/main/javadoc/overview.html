       This is the API specification for <strong>Performetrics</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
       <strong>Performetrics</strong> is a library that provides convenient
       objects to process the elapsed time spent by the Java Virtual Machine
       running your application code. It was carefully designed to offer great
       value in terms of performance and usability, as well as the capability
       to collect data from multiple time sources with a single method call.
    </p>
    <p>
       The following counter types are supported:
    </p>
    <ul>
       <li style="margin-bottom:6px">
          <strong>Wall-clock time:</strong> the elapsed time experienced by
          the user waiting for a task to complete (a metric to evaluate the
          real user experience)
       </li>
       <li style="margin-bottom:6px">
          <strong>CPU time:</strong> the total time spent using a CPU for the
          current thread
       </li>
       <li style="margin-bottom:6px">
          <strong>User time:</strong> the total CPU time that the current
          thread has executed in user mode, i.e., the time spent running
          current thread's code
       </li>
       <li>
          <strong>System time:</strong> the time spent by the OS kernel to
          execute all the basic/system-level operations on behalf of your
          application, such as context switching, resource allocation, etc.
       </li>
